Feature: Setting up the Frontend Environment using React

  Background:
    Given I have access to the project repository
    And I have Node.js and npm installed on my development machine

  Scenario: Set up a new React project
    Given I am starting a new frontend development
    When I run "npx create-react-app my-app" in the command line
    Then a new React project named "my-app" should be created
    And the project should contain default React folders and files

  Scenario: Install essential dependencies
    Given a new React project is set up
    When I install essential dependencies using npm (e.g., react-router, axios)
    Then the dependencies should be added to the package.json file
    And the node_modules folder should contain the installed packages

  Scenario: Set up initial components 
    Given the React Router is configured correctly
    When I create initial React components (e.g., Header, Footer, HomePage)
    Then these components should be properly rendered on the respective routes

  Scenario: Configure Redux for state management 
    Given the initial React components are created
    When I set up Redux by configuring the store, reducers, and actions
    Then the application state should be manageable through Redux

  Scenario: Implement CSS styling with CSS modules 
    Given the initial components are created
    When I apply CSS using modules
    Then each component should reflect the designated styles
