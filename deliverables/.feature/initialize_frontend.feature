Feature: Setting up the Frontend Environment using React

  Background:
    Given I have access to the project repository
    And I have Node.js and npm installed on my development machine

  Scenario: Set up a new React project (Normal Flow)
    Given I am starting a new frontend development
    When I run "npx create-react-app my-app" in the command line
    Then a new React project named "my-app" should be created
    And the project should contain default React folders and files

  Scenario: Install essential dependencies (Normal Flow)
    Given a new React project is set up
    When I install essential dependencies using npm (e.g., react-router, axios)
    Then the dependencies should be added to the package.json file
    And the node_modules folder should contain the installed packages

  Scenario: Install essential dependencies (Error Flow: Incorrect Dependency Version)
    Given a new React project is set up
    When I install an incorrect version of a dependency
    Then npm should return an error
    And guide me to install a correct version

  Scenario: Set up initial routing (Normal Flow)
    Given the essential dependencies are installed
    When I configure the React Router in the App.js file
    Then the application should handle multiple routes
    And display different components based on the URL

  Scenario: Set up initial routing (Error Flow: Incorrect Configuration)
    Given the essential dependencies are installed
    When I misconfigure the React Router
    Then the application should not navigate correctly
    And display errors related to routing

  Scenario: Set up initial components (Normal Flow)
    Given the React Router is configured correctly
    When I create initial React components (e.g., Header, Footer, HomePage)
    Then these components should be properly rendered on the respective routes

  Scenario: Set up initial components (Error Flow: Syntax Errors)
    Given the React Router is configured correctly
    When I write components with JavaScript syntax errors
    Then the application should fail to compile
    And show an error message indicating the syntax issues

  Scenario: Configure Redux for state management (Normal Flow)
    Given the initial React components are created
    When I set up Redux by configuring the store, reducers, and actions
    Then the application state should be manageable through Redux

  Scenario: Configure Redux for state management (Error Flow: Misconfiguration)
    Given the initial React components are created
    When I misconfigure Redux settings
    Then the application should display state management errors

  Scenario: Implement CSS styling with CSS modules (Normal Flow)
    Given the initial components are created
    When I apply CSS using modules
    Then each component should reflect the designated styles

  Scenario: Implement CSS styling (Error Flow: Missing CSS files)
    Given the initial components are created
    When I link to non-existent CSS files
    Then the application should not apply the styles
    And show an error message regarding the missing files

  Scenario: Set up environment variables (Normal Flow)
    Given the project requires API keys
    When I store API keys in a .env file at the project root
    Then the application should access these variables securely

  Scenario: Set up environment variables (Error Flow: Missing .env File)
    Given the project requires API keys
    When I forget to create a .env file
    Then the application should display an error about undefined environment variables

  Scenario: Set up linting and formatting tools (Normal Flow)
    Given the project needs code quality tools
    When I configure ESLint and Prettier
    Then the tools should enforce coding standards

  Scenario: Configure the build process for production (Normal Flow)
    Given the React project is fully developed
    When I run "npm run build"
    Then the application should compile into a build directory ready for production

  Scenario: Configure the build process (Error Flow: Build Failures)
    Given the React project is fully developed
    When I encounter build errors due to unresolved dependencies
    Then the build should fail
    And display error messages indicating the unresolved issues
