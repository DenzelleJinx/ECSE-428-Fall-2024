**ECSE-428

Our team is called HouseIt.

Our project is to develop a webapp that would connect McGill students looking for accommodation and/or roommates. This webapp will allow users (people with a McGill email address) to make postings and conduct filtered searches. The software will need a database to store the listings as well as accounts.

A database will be referenced and otherwise only directly entered information by the user will be used. The program will be accessible from any web browser.
